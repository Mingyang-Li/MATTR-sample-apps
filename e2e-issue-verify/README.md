# Sample-app: E2E credential issuance & verification

## What can this sample-app do for you?

This sample-app is designed to help you with the following:

1. Issuing you a Verifiable Credential to your MATTR Wallet from a UI
2. Requesting your verifiable credential (from step above) via QR code, then show you the information you sent through to the sample-app on a UI

## Why did we build this sample-app?

You might've came across situations like this when you tried to build integrations with our API products:

Sometimes you wanted to issue a credential with certain attributes to you wallet, but you wallet couldn't process it, because you forgot to add the wallet DID into credentialSubject when you created the credential. Or, you wanted to verify a credential from your wallet by scanning a QR code generated by a presentation-request, but your wallet wasn't able to recognise the QR code - Poentially because you've added invalid values to the payload for creating presentation-templates, or that you picked an invalid callback URL for creating presentation-request, or that you've used the wrong DID value for signing the presentation-request... You get the idea, there're lots of moving parts to orchestrate an ecosystem of verifiable credentials, and things are easy to break.

We identified this as an opportunity to provide you with a tool - A tool to help you understand how to implement our APIs in the application-layer, and how the dots connect.

## Use-case:

Issuing & verifying pilot licenses within the Kingdom of Kakapo

## How to run this app locally?

Prerequisites:

1. Access to a MATTR VII tenant - [Sign up if you don't have one](hhttps://mattr.global/contact)
2. An ngrok account - [Sign up if you don't have one](https://ngrok.com/)

Setup guide:

1. Clone this repository
2. Go to the project directory
3. Create a `.env` file in the project folder, paste the contents from `.example.env` into `.env`
4. In terminal, type `ngrok http 3000`
5. In the `.env` file, replace `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=""` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://ngrok-url"`, where `ngrok-url` is the ngrok URL you get from step 4
6. Open another terminal of the same project, type `yarn dev`
7. Open a browser, enter & go to the Ngrok URL

Project scaffolded using [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/).
